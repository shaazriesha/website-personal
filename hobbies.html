        <h1>Sport</h1>
<h3>My hobby is more to sport such as playing badminton with friend. I love to sweating with a good exercise. I can play badminton for 3 to 4 hours because I really can enjoy it. During diploma I am one of UiTM Machang athlete for badminton in Karisma event. For degree I won at 3rd place in badminton tournament in Kota Bharu. For me, badminton is a good sport because, we use a lot of strength to burn back our calories since I am food lover, I think I can balancing back my lifestyle.</h3>
